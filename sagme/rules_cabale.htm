booklet<BR><BR>Preparation<BR><BR>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place the game board 
in the center of the table.<BR><BR>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distribute the 24 
blockades evenly among the players. <BR><BR>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each 
player chooses a color and takes the runner of that 
color.<BR><BR>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The players take the small blocks in 
their chosen color. The number of players determines <BR>how many blocks each 
player keeps: with 2 players, each player keeps all 30 blocks; with 3 
<BR>players, each player keeps 20 blocks; and with 4 players, each player keeps 
15 blocks. <BR><BR>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining blocks, including 
unused colors and any unused runners are returned to the <BR>box. 
<BR><BR>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The players decide, in any way they want who 
is the starting player. The starting player <BR>takes the black marker. 
<BR><BR>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The starting player places his runner on any 
space at the edge of the board. The other <BR>players follow in clockwise order 
and place their runners on any empty space at the edge of <BR>the board. Runners 
may not be placed on corner spaces.<BR><BR>Playing the game<BR><BR>The starting 
player begins and the players follow in clockwise order. On his turn, a player 
<BR>must move his runner, making one turn and placing a block on the turning 
space. If he can, the <BR>player may also capture enemy blocks. Finally, the 
player may place one blockade. <BR><BR>1. First, the player must move his 
runner. He places the black marker on the runner’s starting <BR>space and moves 
the runner in a straight line over one or more empty spaces and then turns 
<BR>left or right to move over one or more empty spaces in the new direction. 
The player puts one <BR>of his colored blocks on the space where the runner 
turned. A runner may never move <BR>diagonally. The runner may move as many 
spaces as the player wants before and after turning.<BR><BR>For example, the 
path marked by a is an allowed route for the runner. The player places a 
<BR>block on the space where the runner turned. The routes marked b and c are 
forbidden. In route <BR>b, the runner does not turn. In route c, the runner 
turns back the way it came instead of to the <BR>right or left. <BR><BR>A space 
is empty if it has neither a runner nor any blocks, whether they be enemy or a 
<BR>player’s own. A runner may also not move over a blockade. The number of 
spaces a runner <BR>moves before he turns has no influence on the number after. 
The runner must turn exactly <BR>once in a turn and must turn left or right. It 
may not turn backward.<BR><BR>The shortest permitted route for a runner is two 
spaces: one forward, turn left or right, move <BR>one space and stop. 
<BR><BR>For example, the green runner begins its turn on space A. The player 
puts the black marker on <BR>this space. The player moves his runner to space B 
and turns there. He puts a green block on <BR>space B and moves his runner to 
space C. After the player decided on an initial direction, he <BR>could have 
turned on any of the spaces before or after B. After turning, he could have 
stopped <BR>the runner on any space before or after C.<BR><BR>Double 
blocks<BR><BR>Instead of placing a single block on the turning space, the player 
may stack two of his blocks <BR>on the space creating a double block. During 
scoring, spaces with double blocks score double. <BR>The number of double stones 
allowed per player is based on the number of players. With two <BR>players, each 
player is allowed 6 double blocks; with 3 players, each player is allowed 4 
<BR>double blocks; and with 4 players, each player is allowed 3 double blocks. 
The player must <BR>decide when the block is placed whether to make it a double 
or not. Once placed, it may not <BR>be changed. Once a player has played the 
maximum number of double blocks allowed, he may <BR>place no 
more.<BR><BR>Capturing enemy blocks<BR><BR>After the player moves his runner, he 
may use the just placed block to capture enemy blocks. <BR>Blocks placed in 
previous rounds may not capture enemy blocks. If his just placed block is 
<BR>adjacent to an enemy block, the player may capture that enemy block if the 
space behind that <BR>block is empty by “jumping” over the enemy block and 
landing on the free space behind it. <BR>The player removes the captured block 
from the board and places it before himself on the <BR>table. Blocks may not 
jump over blockades. The block may continue to capture other enemy <BR>blocks in 
the same row using the same rules as the first capture: the enemy block must be 
<BR>adjacent to the blocks new space and there must be an empty space 
immediately behind it. <BR>The player may capture either single or double 
blocks. When a double block is captures, the <BR>player places it stacked on the 
table to show it was a double block. <BR><BR>For example, the yellow runner 
moves from A to B, turns there and stops on C. The player <BR>places a yellow 
block on B. the player may now jump and capture with this yellow block. <BR>The 
player jumps the red and green blocks (d) and stops on D. The yellow player 
takes the <BR>red and green blocks captured and places them on the table before 
himself. The yellow player <BR>cannot capture the second green block, since the 
space behind it (e) is not empty. Yellow also <BR>cannot capture the second red 
block, since a blockade protects it. <BR><BR>The marker, a player’s own blocks, 
and runners of any player cannot be jumped or captured.<BR><BR>3. Finally, the 
player may place one blockade. Blockades may be placed on the edge of any 
<BR>space anywhere on the board. The blockade need not be placed in a space the 
runner crossed. <BR>Once placed, blockades may not be moved or removed. When a 
player has placed all his <BR>blockades, he may play no more. The edges of 
spaces where a blockade has been placed may <BR>not be crossed by runners or of 
jumping blocks. Once placed, a blockade knows no owner. 
<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>When a player is finished with his turn, he passes the 
black marker to the next player.<BR><BR>Game end and scoring<BR><BR>The game 
ends immediately when a player uses his last block or when a player cannot make 
a <BR>legal move with his runner. <BR><BR>For example, the yellow runner on his 
turn can only move straight, but cannot turn at any <BR>space along his path. 
Thus, the game ends.<BR><BR>Each player adds the value of the spaces his blocks 
occupy, doubling those which are <BR>occupied by double blocks. He also scores 
one point for each captured enemy block and three <BR>points for each captured 
enemy double block. The player with the most points wins. <BR><BR>Tactical 
notes<BR><BR>Try to form “stairs” with your blocks and use blockades to protect 
them from capture. <BR><BR>In this example only the block on space A is in 
danger. It can be jumped and captured from B. <BR>The block on C is safe, since 
it is protected by a blockade. If the player places a blockade on <BR>the edge 
between space A and one of the two spaces marked with B, then block A is now 
<BR>protected from capture. Similarly, the player could try to place blocks on 
one of the spaces <BR>marked with B on his next turn to protect the block on A.
